# cube13h

cube13h is a simple 3D graphics demonstration program written in Turbo C++ and x86 assembly for PC DOS. It demonstrates basic graphics programming techniques to render and animate a 3D cube on the screen, in mode 13h (320x200) colors.
For the EXE file, download it from [itch.io](https://ms0g.itch.io/cube13h).

## Features
- Triangle rasterization.
- 3D vertex transformations.
- Perspective projection to simulate depth.
- Backface culling.
- Bresenham's line algorithm to draw lines between vertices to create the cubeâ€™s edges.
- Double buffering to reduce flickering and tearing.
