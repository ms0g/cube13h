# cube13h

cube13h is a simple 3D graphics demonstration program written in Turbo C and x86 assembly for PC DOS. It demonstrates basic graphics programming techniques to render and animate a 3D cube on the screen, in mode 13h (320x200) colors.
You can download the `EXE` file from [itch.io](https://ms0g.itch.io/cube13h).

|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Triangle rasterization                 | Fills triangle faces on the cube            |
| 3D vertex transformations              | Applies rotation and movement               |
| Perspective projection                 | Simulates depth perception                  |
| Backface culling                       | Hides faces pointing away from the camera   |
| Bresenham's line algorithm             | Draws cube edges pixel by pixel             |
| Double buffering                       | Prevents flickering and tearing             |
